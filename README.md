- This is a console-based Python program for managing a simple bank. It allows users to create accounts, check balances, deposit and withdraw money, and view account details. Users can create a new account with their name, mobile number, location, and an initial balance. They can then perform various transactions such as checking their balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money (with balance validation). The program also provides the option to display account details including name, mobile number, location, and current balance.
